Just put all files on a web server somewhere, and point to `index.html`.

For instance, if you have [Python](http://www.python.org), run
`python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python3 -m http.server` and then browse to
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

(You don't really need the `./generate-maps` directory, unless you're editing
the data files.)
